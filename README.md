# Pluralsight - Angular: Getting Started

## Introduction Notes

### Angular is:

- A JavaScript Framework for building client side applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript

- Expressive HTML

- Power Data-Binding

- Modular by Design - Apps become a set of building blocks

- Built in Back End Integration

### Why a New Angular?

- Built for Speed - Fast change detection, faster initial speeds, improved rendering times

- Modern - Classes Modules and Decorators

- Simplified API - fewer directives, simpler bindings, lower concept count

- Enhances Productivity - Improve our day to day workflow

### Anatomy of an Angular Application

`Application` = `Services(` `Component` + `Component` + (n \* `Component`) `)`

`Component` = `Template` + `Class(Properties + Methods)` + `Metadata`

- Angular Modules have a Root Angular Module that contains Components.

- Angular can have any number of modules, but contains at least one root module.
