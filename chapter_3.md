# Chapter 3 Notes

## TypeScript

- Called it a Language, but its a superset. Not that mission critical, but worth noting.

- JavaScript - ES - ECMAScript standard for JavaScript

- ES2015 - Introduced things like Classes and Arrow Functions

- JavaScript must be transpiled if using newer features.

- TypeScript - Open source language (Started my Microsoft), Superset of JS (There we go), and Transpiles to JavaScript.

- TS is Strongly Typed - Includes things like Inline Documentation, Syntax Checking, Code Navigation, and Advanced Refactorings.

- Class Based Object Orientation

- [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) - Live coding in TS, see the transpiled JavaScript.

- This course focuses on "Learning TS as we go" (perf).

## Visual Studio Code

- Talks about what VSC is, and the basics of history on it.
